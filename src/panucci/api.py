    "playing"                       : ()
        Emitted when the file starts playing.
    "paused"                        : ()
        Emitted when the file is paused.
    "stopped"                       : ()
        Emitted when the file is stopped.
    "end-of-file"                   : ()
        Emitted when the player reaches the end of the file.
    "end-of-playlist"               : ()
        Emitted when the player reaches the end of the playlist.
    "new-track-loaded"              : ()
        Emitted when the player changes track.
    "new-metadata-available"        : ()
        Emitted when new metadata for the current track is available. Use
        the get_metadata function to retrieve it.

	    returns True the playlist will be over-written. Otherwise the
	    over-write will be aborted.
